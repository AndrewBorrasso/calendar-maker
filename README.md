Make simple Calendars to print out

This is one of those projects scratching my own itch. I needed a calendar to keep track of events without a sahred calendar or looking on your next electronical device all of the time.
So I've made a simple style that suits me in CSS using CSS grid and added a little Print Stylesheet on top to make sure things can be printed properly.

Note that this is intended to be printed on A3 (297mm x 420mm) Paper in Portrait.

## How to use it

- Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser
- Alternatively head over to [calendar.jpr.io](https://calendar.jpr.io)
- Choose your year and starting month
- Hit Print and either print directly or to a PDF to take to your printshop.
